Algorithme Dot product
Procedure dot_product(v1: vector of IR, v2: vector of IR, ps: IR)
Begin
    ps := 0;  //Initialize the dot product
    
    For i = 1 to length of v1
        ps := ps + (v1[i] * v2[i]);  //Calculate the dot product
    EndFor
End

Algorithm DetermineOrthogonalVectors
    Input: n (number of pairs of vectors)
    For each pair of vectors (v1, v2) from 1 to n
        Read v1, v2  //Read the vectors
        
        dot_product(v1, v2, ps);  //Calculate the dot product using the procedure
        
        If ps = 0 Then
            Write "Vectors are orthogonal."
        Else
            Write "Vectors are not orthogonal."
